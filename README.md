# Folder.View Custom CSS Files

**Current versions of the CSS styles require Folder.View version 2023.09.22-1**

Custom CSS styles for use with the Folder.View plugin for unRAID by scolcipitato.

Thanks for scolcipitato for the great plugin! If you have a lot of docker containers, Folder.View is a must-have!

Folder.View plugin **[Support Page](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/142782-plugin-folderview/)** on the unRAID forum.

If you have issues or customization suggestions, contact me on the unRAID forum. @Mattaton

The files in this repo should replace or be appended to custom css files within the Folder.View plugin folder here: **/boot/config/plugins/folder.view/styles**

These files customize the icons on the Dashboard and Docker page. Special icons for autostart containers and the folders that hold autostart containers make it easy to see, at a glance, if all of your autostart containers are running as they should.
Icons are fully customizable (design, color, and size) via custom properties (variables) at the top of each file.
The Dashboard custom file also styles the expanded folders to make it clear which containers are inside.
